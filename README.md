## Overview

South Asia is a dynamic region with diverse economic and social indicators. This project explores key metrics across countries to reveal trends, patterns, and relationships, utilizing statistical analysis, machine learning, and data visualization techniques.

## Data Source

The dataset includes various socio-economic metrics for South Asian countries. This data may be directly accessible in the repository or may require external sourcing.

## Key Analyses and Features

### 1. Data Preparation
   - **Data Cleaning**: Managed missing values and ensured consistency.
   - **Normalization & Standardization**: Applied scaling to metrics for clustering and comparative analysis.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   - **Statistical Summaries**: Key statistical summaries for data overview.
   - **Visualization of Key Metrics**: Visualized trends across indicators like GDP, unemployment, and population demographics.
   
### 3. Comparative Analysis
   - **Country-by-Country Comparison**: Compared socio-economic metrics across South Asian countries.
   - **Correlation Analysis**: Explored relationships between indicators, like GDP growth and unemployment rate.

### 4. Clustering and Grouping
   - **KMeans Clustering**: Grouped countries based on economic indicators.
   - **Scatter Plot Visualization**: Used interactive Plotly scatter plots to visualize clusters.

### 5. Governance and Stability Metrics
   - **Governance Metric Analysis**: Analyzed governance metrics like control of corruption and political stability.
   - **Correlation Matrix**: Created heatmaps for governance metrics.

### 6. Forecasting
   - **GDP Growth Forecasting**: Used Exponential Smoothing to forecast GDP growth for select countries.
